When I was 7, I decided to swim from Cleveland to Canada across Lake Erie. I got tired when I was pretty far out in the water, and I had to cling to a buoy until I was rescued by a fishing boat. When they pulled me in, I was so intrigued by their lifestyle that I asked them to work on their boat. They agreed to let me work with them on the way back in. I helped them pull in a net, which contained a rare Bengal Catfish, a troublesome invasive species. This was the first time that anyone had seen this fish in Lake Erie, and this early warning helped them start a program to remove the Bengal Catfish from Lake Erie. Estimates of the money saved to the city's fisheries range from $10 to $50 million. The fishers insisted that I had found this fish on my own, so the Cleveland Marine Admiral made me one of the recipients of the year's Admiral's Award.
